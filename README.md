# iOSCrashDemo
Sample app to demonstrate iOS 14.2 Crash  
  
This app shows a crash that has been introduced with iOS 14.2 when using AVAudioUnitEffects. It should crash upon immediately pushing the single button in the app but if not you can update the code to use the EQ audio unit together with either the reverb or the delay unit (or both). Upon multiple presses, it will result in a crash.
